Immunization is a global health and development success story, saving millions of lives every year. Vaccines reduce risks of getting a disease by working with your body‚Äôs natural defences to build protection. When you get a vaccine, your immune system responds.<br><br>

We now have vaccines to prevent more than 20 life-threatening diseases, helping people of all ages live longer, healthier lives. Immunization currently prevents 3.5-5 million deaths every year from diseases like diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, influenza and measles.<br><br>

Immunization is a key component of primary health care and an indisputable human right. It‚Äôs also one of the best health investments money can buy. Vaccines are also critical to the prevention and control of infectious disease outbreaks. They underpin global health security and will be a vital tool in the battle against antimicrobial resistance.<br><br>

Yet despite tremendous progress, vaccination coverage has plateaued in recent years and dropped since 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic and associated disruptions over the past two year have strained health systems, with 25 million children missing out on vaccination in 2021, 6 million more than in 2019 and the highest number since 2009.<br><br>

By the end of 2021, nearly all countries had introduced COVID-19 vaccination, and by early 2022 one billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been delivered through COVAX.<br><br>

<b>How do vaccines work?</b><br><br>
Germs are all around us, both in our environment and in our bodies. When a person is susceptible and they encounter a harmful organism, it can lead to disease and death.<br><br>

The body has many ways of defending itself against <b>pathogens</b> (disease-causing organisms). Skin, mucus, and cilia (microscopic hairs that move debris away from the lungs) all work as physical barriers to prevent pathogens from entering the body in the first place. <br><br>

When a pathogen does infect the body, our body‚Äôs defences, called the immune system, are triggered and the pathogen is attacked and destroyed or overcome.
